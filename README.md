# TypeScript Type Error: Number + String

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript type error that occurs when performing arithmetic operations on variables of mismatched types (specifically, number and string).

The `bug.ts` file contains a function `add` that is intended to add two numbers. However, it incorrectly attempts to add a number and a string.  The TypeScript compiler correctly flags this as an error.

The `bugSolution.ts` file shows how to correctly type the function and avoid the type error.
